Hello! My name is Abhishek, I am a Bay Area native and a current fourth year medical student at University of Michigan. From a young age I have been fascinated with computers and biology. I found an intersection between the two in undergrad while [working at UCSF](https://www.news.ucsb.edu/2017/018088/treat-or-not-treat). 

The experience set me on the path of one day becoming a physician scientist. My mission is to learn from the needs of my patients and leverage my background in computer science to build novel solutions that can benefit everybody. 

At the moment, that has meant working with Dr. Hollon at the [Machine Learning in Neurosurgery Lab](https://hollon.lab.medicine.umich.edu/) to devise a new method for single cell analysis of brain tumors using vision-based AI. I am also taking my experience at the [local free clinic](https://www.umstudentrunfreeclinic.org/) to create a digital social health platform called OneClinic.
